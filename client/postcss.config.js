// to This code is typically used in a project that uses a module bundler like webpack or Parcel and requires the use of the Tailwind CSS framework. By including the tailwindcss plugin in the configuration, it allows the CSS generated by Tailwind to be processed by the bundler and included in the final output bundle.

//The purpose of using the autoprefixer plugin is to ensure that the compiled CSS is compatible with a wide range of browsers by automatically adding vendor prefixes. Without this plugin, developers would need to manually add vendor prefixes to the CSS rules which can be a time-consuming and error-prone task.
